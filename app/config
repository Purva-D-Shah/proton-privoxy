# confdir: Where Privoxy looks for its other configuration files.
# Standard files like default.action, default.filter are expected here.
confdir /etc/privoxy

# logdir: Directory where Privoxy will write its logfile.
# app/run creates this directory.
logdir /var/log/privoxy

# logfile: Name of the logfile within logdir.
logfile logfile

# listen-address: IP address and port Privoxy listens on.
listen-address  0.0.0.0:8100

# actionsfile: Defines Privoxy's filtering behavior based on URLs.
# These will point to the (empty) files copied by the Dockerfile.
actionsfile default.action
actionsfile match-all.action

# user.action: For your custom actions.
# Commented out unless you intend to provide /etc/privoxy/user.action.
# Privoxy usually doesn't error if this is listed and missing, but best to be explicit.
# actionsfile user.action

# filterfile: Defines text-based content filters.
# `default.filter` is provided by COPYing `empty.filter` from your project
# to `/etc/privoxy/default.filter` in the Dockerfile.
filterfile default.filter

# `user.filter` is commented out as we are not providing it by default.
# If you need custom filters, create user.filter in project, COPY it, and uncomment.
# filterfile user.filter

# Debugging levels:
# 4096: Log startup banner and warnings (good for normal operation).
# To see all requests: debug 1
# For very verbose troubleshooting (can be noisy): debug 13313
# (1=requests, 1024=header/action info, 4096=startup, 8192=remote connections)
debug   4096
